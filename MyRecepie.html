        Poha is a traditional Indian dish made from flattened rice flakes. It's
        a quick and easy-to-prepare dish that involves rinsing the rice flakes,
        sautéing them with spices, vegetables, and often peanuts, and garnishing
        with fresh herbs and lemon juice. Poha has a delightful balance of
        textures, with soft and chewy rice flakes and a medley of savory
        flavors. It's a popular breakfast or snack option, loved for its
        simplicity and adaptability, and can be customized with various
        ingredients to suit personal tastes
